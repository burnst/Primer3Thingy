<h1>Application Bootstrap</h1>

<p>This page will bootstrap the state of the database by loading in lookup data and other instances
that are important to get the dispatch application started and up and running so that you can log
in and use, test, and enhance the application.</p>

<p>This expects you to have mongodb installed and running on your development box.  It also expects
to be able to contact the campus IDW during account setup, so make sure you hooked up to the VPN
if you are running remotely. The following database objects will be setup by this controller.</p>


<ol>
    <li><span style="color:#c00">the "p3thingy" database will be deleted!</span></li>
    <li>a "p3thingy" database will be created</li>
</ol>
